## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating web apps
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python (Django, Pygame, UnitTest) and Java (Junit, Mockito)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...

- âš¡ Fun fact:

Whilst I get my GitHub looking respectable, here's a brief introduction into projects I want to share:


[Gigify](https://github.com/tudley/Gigify)

[NOTE: This project is in early stages of construction]

- This purpose of this project is to create a web service which allows you to link your spotify account, and creates a playlist based on your preferences, with artists that have upcoming shows in your area.
- This project is focussed on using new tech stacks with a lightweight framework - im just looking to prototpye a web service leveraging Flasks minimal structure, and try to incorporate some React and [MUI](https://mui.com/) assets, so I can focus on learning a new stack and interfacing with multiple APIs.

[SocialMediaClone](https://github.com/tudley/SocialMediaClone)

- Winning no points in originality, This porject is as it says on the tin - I'm trying to create a functional social media site.
- This started out as a way to practise using relational database models, with Profiles owning Posts, owning Pictures, Comments and Likes.
- How its going? Some confusion learning how django handles media and static files, but all databases are interacting happily (for now) and its onto making the frontend nice.
- This is my first go at HTML and CSS, and I would like to learn JS for submitting forms without a refresh ect. but I want to solidify the concepts laid above before adding complexity.

[SnookerGame](https://github.com/tudley/SnookerGame)

- renamed to 'snooker' in case people think it's to do with swimming, in hindsight 'billiards' would have been better...
- This project has been an experiment to combine my appreciation for mathemtatical mechanics and coding. I have used real world equations to model the balls interactions with eachother as close to real life as possible. (NOTE: My friction force is an arbitrary value - I have limits).
- Not much more to say about this project, my second pygame project where everything is build using rects and circles, no sprites. This project shows my ability to connect real world problem solving skills with automated solutions.

[GameOfLife](https://github.com/tudley/GameOfLife)

- If you dont know what Conways Game of Life is (and no, its not Hasbro classic board game), this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9Plq-D1gEk) is a good introduction to the concept
- Effectviely, the game consists of a grid, with each cell evaluation how many neighbours are alive (colour 1) and how many are dead (colour 2). If certain metrics are met, the cell may change from one state to another.
- In my version of it, the user can make a pattern of 'live' cells, and then 'run' the simulation where it iterates over the sequence of states it achieves.
- The user can iterate once, forward and back, automate the iteration, export and import custom patterns using JSON files.
